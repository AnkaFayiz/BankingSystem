I am making Banking Management System using Python

This is another code that i've been made and it's very fun to do with Python

On this program, there will be user input for account number and account name. Then, the program will process the data that user has been inputed and 
showing the details about the account, which is the account number, name, and balance.

User can deposit the money and withdraw it as long the amount not bigger than balance

User can change the information about the account, but now it's only the name not the others 

So, feel free to use this or try to give some advice for me to be better than before :)
